# QWERTY-Text-Prediction

## About
Text prediction algorithm for Android keyboard using Trie data structure

## How to install
1. Create new C++ empty project and download main.cpp file to it

2. In the same folder where is main.cpp create new text document with name file.txt

3. As you type more words the algorithm will become more accurate because of the way Trie data structure works

4. If you allready have text file with some content you can put it instead of empty file,<br/> that way it'll have data to work with at the beginning

## How to use
I put all functions and structures in one file, but you can easy separate it for clear view.

You can use all functions and structures in your projects or as a pseudo-code, they're all written clear without unnececery variables and comments.

Examples of use of functions are all displayed in the main function.
